# KEYBOARD AND SYNTAX LITERACY
super important to communication with other devs!  

1. brackets, including [ ], { }, ( ), and < >
- [ ] are "square brackets" or "array brackets".  most commonly used for array indexing or object keys.
- { } are "curly brackets". you'll hear me call them "curlies" out of laziness. used for many things, like opening loop and function code blocks, objects, and more.
- ( ) are "parentheses" or "round brackets" or "curved brackets", but probably just say "parentheses". I might even say "parenths" out of laziness but you can (and should) chastise me for this :dusty_stick:. used for function parameters, conditionals, loop parameters, and more.
- < > are "arrow brackets" or "angle brackets" in a non-math context. most commonly used for HTML tags. in math, they are obviously "lesser than" or "greater than".

2. quotes, including " , ' , and `
- " and ' are "double and single quotes", typically interchangeable and used with strings. they either start or end a string, thus, nested quotes must not use the initial quote style. ie, "this is a 'string'" is valid, "this is a "string"" is not.
- `  are "backticks" or simply "ticks", used with ES6 template string syntax, and can typically be used in place of other quotes.
3. | is the "pipe" symbol, invoked as part of ||, the conditional "or". you can say "double pipes", but try to say the "or symbol" instead. found on the \ key above Enter on most keyboards.
4. & is the "ampersand", used in &&, the "and symbol" in conditionals. you could say "double ampersand" but that's a mouthful and people will look at you weird. :eyes:
5. / is the "forward slash" or just "slash". \ is the "backward slash" or just "backslash".
6. : is the "colon", typically used with objects. ; is the "semicolon", typically used as a line or loop argument delimiter.
7. writing a function you've declared, ie myFunc, with parentheses, ie myFunc(), is called "calling" or "executing" or "running" or "invoking" that function. there's lots of words for this. "invoking" makes you sound like a wizard which is always fun.
