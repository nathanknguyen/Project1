# Useful Links

Here is a collection of links that support the curriculum and fill in knowledge gaps. I will refer to these during the course.

## Learning how to code

## Things to follow

As with any profession, staying up with trends is vital to growth. Here are a handful of things that I follow.

- [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com)
- [web.dev](https://web.dev/blog/)

## Books

I'm always in need of refernce material. Books are usually helpful to get up and running quickly, but end up outdated within a year or two. An annual subscription to a book publisher give you access to their entire library and those books get updated.

### Open Source Contributing

- [FIRST TIMERS ONLY](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [up-for-grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)

## Markdown

Markdown (.md) files like this one have become the way to document code projects. It is a lightweight markup language that is written in a text editor (like VS Code) and viewed in a markdown reader (like VS Code).
To view a markdown document in VS Code, right click the document in the project tree or in the open editors and select "Open Preview".

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Command Line

Most of your code is built and distributed using the command line. A script triggered by a single command can save you hours and stress over time.

## Github.io

- [How long does it take for GitHub page to show changes after changing index.html?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24851824/how-long-does-it-take-for-github-page-to-show-changes-after-changing-index-html#:~:text=3%20Answers&text=The%20first%20time%20you%20generate,changes%20to%20your%20GitHub%20repository.)

### More on Git commit messages

**Do**

- do keep the message short (less than 60-ish characters)
- do explain what the commit does (not how or why!)

**Do not**

- do not explain why the changes are made (more on this below)
- do not explain how the changes are made (that's what git log -p is for!)
- do not use the word "and"  
   if you have to use "and", your commit message is probably doing too many changes - break the changes into separate commits
  e.g. "make the background color pink and increase the size of the sidebar"

```
__proto__ is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc.
prototype is the object that is used to build __proto__ when you create an object with new:

( new Foo ).__proto__ === Foo.prototype;
( new Foo ).prototype === undefined;
```

- [Are middlewares an implementation of the Decorator pattern?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48696631/are-middlewares-an-implementation-of-the-decorator-pattern)

> Middleware and decorators are similar and can do the same job. They provide a means of inserting intermediary effects either before or after other effects downstream in the chain/stack.
>
> A difference is that the middleware pipeline is computed using a reduction that presents the middleware with a simpler interface that hides the next middleware object in the chain. Rather it presents a next function that applies the message to that object using the correct interface (e.g. IHandler.handle).
>
> Another difference is that it is easier to dynamically add/remove middleware because it exists in the middle of a container object (e.g. in an array) and the pipeline can be assembled on demand. A decorator is a stack of Russian dolls and its stack cannot so easily be rejiggered.
