# UW-SEA-FSF-PT-03-2021-U-C Bootcamp Class Repository

Welcome to your UW Full Stack Web Development class repository (Spring 2021).

Class Instructor: John Young (john@codeandcreative.com)

## How to use

As you will learn, web developers and coders in general work together as a team through a **version control system**. The most popular one is called `git`. Our class will use a `git` **repository** ("repo") for short to distribute class materials.

This is a one-way repository, i.e., you only pull content from it. You will never need to push content. This is your reference material, not where you turn in your homework.

Before each class, make sure you perform a `git pull` to get the latest class material.

## Contents

The repository is divided into two sections:

1. `class-content`: This is where class work happens. There is a folder for each week. Each week is a little different but in general you should find the following:

- `README.md`: Each week has a `README` describing the week's content. A great pre-read for the week, this file outlines learning objectives and ways to assess your understanding.
- `Activities`: These are in-class activities. This is where you apply what is discussed in class lectures. Generally, we go through all of the activities but some are left as supplemental. Activities incorporate concepts required to complete that week's homework. Some activities are just demonstration, others are `Unsolved` exercises that you complete during class. After attempting an activity in class, the instructor will provide a `Solved` version for your review. Activities are hard. It is in your interest to review them again after class. **HINT:** Activities usually provide code that is useful to complete homeworks.
- `Homework`: This is the homework for the week. It is typically assigned the first class of the week and due the same day the follwing week. For example, if a week starts on Tuesday, the assignment is due the following Tuesday. Each homework will have a `README.md` describing the requirements for completion. There is a separate grading rubric that we will sometimes share with you if we feel it helps communicate the requirements. Sometimes a homework assignment has starter code, sometimes it doesn't. If it has starter code it will be in a `Develop` folder. When you start a homework project, please take the starter code out of the provided `Develop` folder and put it in the root of your homework's `git` project.
- `Algorithims`: Starting in week 3, we will provide you with code puzzles. These are not directly addressed in class, but they are a useful practice of the Javascript language and problem solving.
- `Career-Connection`: This puts the week's curriculum in a job hunt perspective: why is this content relevant? In the interest of tying your class work to practical application, the Career Connection shows relevance and some tips to expanding your understanding so that you are employer competitive upoin completion of the course.
- `Important`: Some weeks introduce a new skill that requires some extra material (e.g., installing `mysql` or deploying to `heroku`). The `Important` folder will supply a how-to guide you can refer back to.
- `Slides`: Any slides shown during class will be offered here

2. `supplemental`: John will sometimes put files discussed in class here to supplement learning.

3. `links.md`: This is a collection of web links compiled by John over the last few years. He will call some of these out in class, providing them as pre-reads for the next class.
